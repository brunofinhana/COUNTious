# COUNTious - Awareness Counter

COUNTious is a multi-purpose, web-app counter intended to raise awarness about how many times a user do something specific (e.g.: how many water bottles they drink).

This project was created to help me practice some JavaScript skills learned recently. I wanted a project that would not only put those skills into practice, but also something interesting, authentic and, more importantly, useful to the end user.

Any comment, opinion, issue created, or any form of feedback is more than appreciated!

## Skills practiced in this project: 
- Basic use and hierarchical organization of HTML tags;
- Basic styling of root and personalized elements, including both aesthetical and responsive adjustments, with CSS;
- Basic DOM manipulation, use of variables, and functions with JavaScript;
- Basic UI/UX principles applyed, such as: legibility, visual consistency and hierarchy, clear actions, and mobile optimization;
- Basic use of Git and GitHub, including: Repository creation, local and remote editing, commits, push requests, and merge.
