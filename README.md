# COUNTious

This is a unique project to help me test some JavaScript skills learned.

COUNTious is a multi-purpose manual counter web-app intended to bring awarness to the user about how many times they do something specific during a given period of time (ex: how many water bottles they drink in one hour).

Skills used in this project: 
- Basic HTML tags and hierarchy; 
- Styling of root and personalized classes, including both aesthetical and responsiveness adjustments; 
- Basic JavaScript functionality: variable manipulation (incrementation and decrementation)
